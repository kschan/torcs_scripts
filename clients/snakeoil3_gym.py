# Snake Oil is a Python library for interfacing with a TORCS
# race car simulator which has been patched with the server
# extentions used in the Simulated Car Racing competitions.
# http://scr.geccocompetitions.com/
#
# To use it, you must import it and create a "drive()" function.
# This will take care of option handling and server connecting, etc.
# To see how to write your own client do something like this which is
# a complete working client:
# /-----------------------------------------------\
# |#!/usr/bin/python                              |
# |import snakeoil                                |
# |if __name__ == "__main__":                     |
# |    C= snakeoil.Client()                       |
# |    for step in xrange(C.maxSteps,0,-1):       |
# |        C.get_servers_input()                  |
# |        snakeoil.drive_example(C)              |
# |        C.respond_to_server()                  |
# |    C.shutdown()                               |
# \-----------------------------------------------/
# This should then be a full featured client. The next step is to
# replace 'snakeoil.drive_example()' with your own. There is a
# dictionary which holds various option values (see `default_options`
# variable for all the details) but you probably only need a few
# things from it. Mainly the `trackname` and `stage` are important
# when developing a strategic bot.
#
# This dictionary also contains a ServerState object
# (key=S) and a DriverAction object (key=R for response). This allows
# you to get at all the information sent by the server and to easily
# formulate your reply. These objects contain a member dictionary "d"
# (for data dictionary) which contain key value pairs based on the
# server's syntax. Therefore, you can read the following:
#    angle, curLapTime, damage, distFromStart, distRaced, focus,
#    fuel, gear, lastLapTime, opponents, racePos, rpm,
#    speedX, speedY, speedZ, track, trackPos, wheelSpinVel, z
# The syntax specifically would be something like:
#    X= o[S.d['tracPos']]
# And you can set the following:
#    accel, brake, clutch, gear, steer, focus, meta
# The syntax is:
#     o[R.d['steer']]= X
# Note that it is 'steer' and not 'steering' as described in the manual!
# All values should be sensible for their type, including lists being lists.
# See the SCR manual or http://xed.ch/help/torcs.html for details.
#
# If you just run the snakeoil.py base library itself it will implement a
# serviceable client with a demonstration drive function that is
# sufficient for getting around most tracks.
# Try `snakeoil.py --help` to get started.
